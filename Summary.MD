In summary we did lots of coding however in the ReadMe file we just put in the most important parts. In the github we have shown the calculations for different backends, optimisers and ansatz. 
If you have any questions please don't hestitae to ask as we do have a lot of code. We thoroughly enjoyed this task and have learnt a lot.
